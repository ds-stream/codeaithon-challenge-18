# Iris Species Classification Model

## Task Instructions

### Brief Description
Participants are required to develop a machine learning model to classify iris species based on measurements of their sepals and petals using the Iris dataset. The objective is to apply data processing, model training, and evaluation techniques to predict the species with high accuracy.

### Expected Sequence of Steps

**Step 1: Retrieve Data**
- Load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.

**Step 2: Process the Data**
- Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as scaling or normalizing the data.

**Step 3: Create Visualizations**
- Generate visualizations to explore the data distributions and relationships between features.

**Step 4: Model Training**
- Train at least two different classification models using scikit-learn.

**Step 5: Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate and compare the performance of the models based on their accuracy and visualize the decision boundaries.
